GoGame
======
The file GoEngineFinal.py contains the python code which simulates a game of Go between two players (both can be human or machine) 
and contains functions and classes that define the board characteristics, rules of the game, and scoring rules.

An intelligent algorithm based on the technique of Monte Carlo Tree Search + Upper Confidence Bound for Trees is developed based on 
the research paper S. Gelly, L. Kocsis, M. Schoenauer, M. Sebag, D. Silver, C. Szepesvari, and O. Teytaud. 'The grand challenge of computer Go: Monte Carlo tree search and extensions.' Communications of the ACM, 55(3):106â€“113, 2012.

Simulations of random v/s intelligent and intelligent v/s intelligent with different values of parameters can be done, and this helps in researching
the contributions of individual paramteres towards the probability of winning the game.

The intelligence part of the code can be extended and other intelligent algorithms can be implemented and added to improve performace in the game.
